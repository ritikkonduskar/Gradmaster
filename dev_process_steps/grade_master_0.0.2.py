# What we have done: we have refined the pseudocode outline

# read in the CSV file with the raw data of grades 
    # open file
    # read in line by line
    # close file

# parse and process the raw data, put it into a useful data structure
    # use commas for split operation
    # read into a data structure
    # convert into numerical values
    # figure out what kind of data structure would be useful

# perform statistics, analysis, projections
    # compute current average according to grading rules 
    # convert points into letter grades
    # test different grading schemes 
    # rank students according to performance
    # generate statistical analysis
    # identify best, worst students
    # inform students where they stand, if problems are looming
    # cheating detector that flags anomalies
    # visualization of findings
    # everything should be automated and run on-the-fly throughout the semester
    # show performance development over semester (identify issues with course)
    # figure out in detail what we want to do
